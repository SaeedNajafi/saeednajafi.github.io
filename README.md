# Hello!
Welcome to my minimal academic homepage :)
<br> <br>
I currently work at [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com/) as an ML engineer.
<br>
I obtained my M.Sc. in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I started my
research in NLP under the supervision of the Professors [Colin Cherry](https://sites.google.com/site/colinacherry/) and [Greg Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/).
<br>
Before joining UofA, I did my BSc. in Software Engineering at the Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran.
