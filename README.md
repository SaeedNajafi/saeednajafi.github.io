# Hello!

<img src="./my_pic.jpeg" width="250" height="334">

Welcome to my academic homepage!
<br> <br>
I'm Saeed Najafi, a 5th-year PhD candidate at the University of Alberta, thrilled to be working under the supervision of Dr. [Alona Fyshe](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home).

<br>
I'm currently a research intern at the Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Toronto, where we're exploring methods to improve the efficiency of large language models during both training and inference.  Previously, I gained valuable experience as an ML engineer at [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com), and as an intern at the [Vector Institute](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/PromptEngineering) and [Google](https://arvr.google.com).

My academic journey began with a Master's degree in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Professors [Colin Cherry](https://sites.google.com/site/colinacherry/) and [Greg Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/) in the field of natural language processing.  Before joining the UofA, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran (2012-2016).

You can find my latest CV [here](https://github.com/SaeedNajafi/saeednajafi.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf)

<br>
I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and engage in discussions related to large language models and machine learning.  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, or if you'd simply like to connect!
