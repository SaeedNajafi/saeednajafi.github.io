# Hello!
Welcome to my minimal academic homepage :)
<br> <br>
I have started my Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. [Alona Fyshe](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) at the University of Alberta.
I am currently investigating question-anwering systems for machine comprehension.
<br>
Previously, I worked at [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com/) as an ML engineer between 2018 and 2020.
I also obtained my M.Sc. in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I started my
research in NLP under the supervision of the Professors [Colin Cherry](https://sites.google.com/site/colinacherry/) and [Greg Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/).
<br>
Before joining UofA, I did my B.Sc. in Software Engineering at the Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran (2012-2016).
