# Hello!

<img src="./my_pic.jpeg" width="250" height="334">

Welcome to my academic homepage!
<br> <br>
I'm Saeed Najafi, a 5th-year PhD candidate at the University of Alberta, thrilled to be working under the supervision of Dr. [Alona Fyshe](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home).

<br>

I'm also a research intern at the Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Toronto, where we're exploring methods to improve the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) during both training and inference.  Previously, I gained valuable experience as an ML engineer at [BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com), and as an intern at the [Vector Institute](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/PromptEngineering) and [Google](https://arvr.google.com).

My academic journey began with a Master's degree in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Professors [Colin Cherry](https://sites.google.com/site/colinacherry/) and [Greg Kondrak](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/) in the field of Natural Language Processing.  Before joining UofA, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran (2012-2016).

You can find my latest CV [here](https://github.com/SaeedNajafi/saeednajafi.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf).

<br>

I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and engage in discussions related to LLMs and machine learning.  Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saeednajafi/) if you have any questions, or if you'd simply like to connect!
